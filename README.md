    <h2 style="text-align: center;">üöÄ Current State of the System</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;">This project is in the <strong>very early stages</strong> of development. It currently monitors a selected list of Solana wallets, tracking new token holdings and balance changes. Alerts are sent to a dedicated channel on Discord, and <strong>all alerts should be treated with caution</strong>. Remember to do your own research (DYOR) when making any financial decisions based on this data.</p>

## Project Vision
The vision is to develop a sophisticated Go-based tool for automated tracking and analysis of Solana wallet behaviors. This project will evolve from a simple monitoring tool into a comprehensive on-chain analysis platform capable of identifying potential insider trading activities.

**Building in Public**: Follow along as the project develops! Contributions, feedback, and discussions are welcome and encouraged.
