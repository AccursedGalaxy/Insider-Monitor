# Solana Wallet Monitoring and On-Chain Analysis Tool - Project Overview

## Project Vision
The vision for this project is to develop a sophisticated Go-based tool that automates the tracking and analysis of Solana wallet behaviors,
offering comprehensive insights into token movements and potential insider trading activities.

The system will evolve from a basic monitoring tool to a comprehensive on-chain analysis platform.

**Building in Public**: Follow along as this project grows and evolves!
Contributions, feedback, and discussions are highly encouraged to shape this tool into the ultimate on-chain analysis resource.

## Current Status
The current version monitors a defined list of Solana wallets for new token holdings and balance changes, storing data in a simple JSON-based system and providing basic alerts.
The foundation is set, and it's time to enhance the system with more advanced features!

## Next Steps and Strategic Enhancements

### 1. **Behavior-Based Wallet Filtering**
   - Develop filters to prioritize high-value wallets.
   - Focus on wallets with consistent, repeatable, and profitable trading behaviors.
   - **Action Items**:
     - Define criteria for high-value behaviors (e.g., historical profit, frequency of strategic trades).
     - Implement a scoring system to rank wallets based on these criteria.

### 2. **Cluster and Group Monitoring**
   - Implement clustering techniques to identify groups of wallets that exhibit coordinated behavior.
   - Use data science methods to detect patterns of simultaneous buying/selling.
   - **Approach**:
     - **Data Collection**: Track the transaction history of each wallet and record token movements.
     - **Feature Extraction**: Extract relevant features like transaction timestamps, token types, and amounts.
     - **Clustering Algorithms**: Use algorithms like DBSCAN or K-Means to group wallets based on transaction similarities.
     - **Pattern Recognition**: Analyze clusters to identify if multiple wallets are trading the same token at the same time.
   - **Outcome**: A system that alerts when a coordinated activity is detected.

### 3. **Anomaly and Pattern Detection**
   - Build models to detect anomalies such as dormant wallets suddenly becoming active or large, unusual transactions.
   - **Approach**:
     - Implement rule-based systems for detecting straightforward anomalies.
     - Use machine learning for more complex pattern recognition.
   - **Potential Models**: Isolation Forests for anomaly detection or time-series models for activity predictions.

### 4. **Coordinated Buying/Selling Detection**
   - Develop a system to flag tokens being bought or sold by multiple wallets in a short time frame.
   - **Steps to Implement**:
     - **Transaction Aggregation**: Collect and aggregate transactions for analysis.
     - **Correlation Analysis**: Calculate correlation coefficients to see if wallets are acting in tandem.
     - **Alert System**: Extend the alerting mechanism to notify when coordinated trades are detected.

## Considerations & Restrictions

### 1. **Data Acquisition and Rate Limits**
   - Stay within Solana RPC rate limits.
   - Implement efficient and cached data fetching strategies.

### 2. **Scalability**
   - Ensure the architecture can handle an increasing number of wallets.
   - Plan for database migration if needed as the data volume grows.

- **Tasks**:
  - Define metrics for wallet scoring (e.g., historical profits, token diversity).
  - Implement algorithms to calculate and store wallet scores.

### Phase 7: Clustering and Coordinated Activity Detection
- **Goal**: Implement clustering to detect coordinated buying/selling.
- **Tasks**:
  - Extract transaction features and apply clustering algorithms.
  - Develop a system to monitor and alert for group activity.

### Phase 8: Anomaly Detection and Machine Learning
- **Goal**: Add machine learning models for sophisticated pattern recognition.
- **Tasks**:
  - Train and deploy models to detect unusual activities.
  - Implement automated anomaly alerts.

### Phase 9: Web Dashboard and Visualization
- **Goal**: Build a web-based dashboard for real-time insights.
- **Tasks**:
  - Design intuitive visualizations for wallet activity and patterns.
  - Integrate the monitoring tool with the web interface.

### Phase 10: Community Engagement and Collaboration
- **Goal**: Engage the on-chain analysis community for feedback and contributions.
- **Tasks**:
  - Share progress updates and gather community input.
  - Implement requested features and enhancements based on feedback.
