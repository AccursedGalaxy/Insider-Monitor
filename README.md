# Solana Wallet Monitoring Tool - Project Overview

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a Go-based tool that monitors specific Solana wallet addresses for new, significant token holdings.
This tool will help identify potential insider trading activities, such as wallets acquiring low-cap coins before major exchange listings,
and will operate using cost-free methods for data acquisition.

## Key Features

1. **Wallet Monitoring**
   - Ability to monitor multiple wallet addresses simultaneously.
   - Fetch and list all current token holdings for specified wallet addresses.
   - Identify and track new token holdings added after the initial scan.

2. **Token Account Tracking**
   - Use the Solana Go SDK (`gagliardetto/solana-go`) to fetch and manage token accounts.
   - Retrieve token balances and associated token mint addresses.
   - Determine the creation time of each token account to avoid redundant alerts.

3. **Data Persistence**
   - Store wallet and token data in a simple, cost-effective format (e.g., JSON file or lightweight database).
   - Maintain historical records to compare and detect new token additions over time.

4. **Alerting System**
   - Implement a placeholder alerting system (e.g., logging or simple notifications) to notify of significant changes.
   - Future support for more sophisticated alerts, like email or push notifications.

## Considerations & Restrictions

1. **Data Acquisition Limits**
   - Be mindful of the rate limits imposed by Solana RPC nodes.
   - Implement efficient data fetching and consider using exponential backoff for retries if requests fail.

2. **Initial Scan Handling**
   - On the first scan, store all current token accounts without raising alerts.
   - Only generate alerts for new token accounts detected in subsequent scans.

3. **Associated Token Accounts (ATAs)**
   - Handle and recognize associated token accounts, which are standard on Solana.
   - Ensure that data retrieval methods are comprehensive enough to detect these accounts properly.

4. **Performance and Scalability**
   - The tool should efficiently handle multiple wallet addresses and data retrievals.
   - Design for scalability if the number of monitored wallets increases.

5. **Persistent Storage**
   - Use a simple and lightweight storage solution (e.g., JSON file) for the initial implementation.
   - Consider migrating to a more robust database (e.g., SQLite) if the data volume grows significantly.

## Project Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Setup
- **Goal**: Set up the project structure and dependencies.
- **Tasks**:
  - Initialize a new Go project and configure the Go environment.
  - Install the `gagliardetto/solana-go` SDK and test basic blockchain queries.

### Phase 2: Wallet Monitoring Functionality
- **Goal**: Implement wallet monitoring to fetch and list token holdings.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop functions to retrieve all token accounts for a given wallet.
  - Extract token mint addresses and balances.
  - Handle data retrieval and error management.

### Phase 3: Token Account Creation Time
- **Goal**: Determine when token accounts were created to prevent initial scan alerts.
- **Tasks**:
  - Fetch transaction history for token accounts and extract creation times.
  - Compare transaction timestamps to identify new additions accurately.

### Phase 4: Data Persistence
- **Goal**: Implement a basic data storage system.
- **Tasks**:
  - Create a mechanism to store and load token account data using JSON.
  - Ensure data is stored securely and efficiently.

### Phase 5: Alerting System
- **Goal**: Develop a basic alerting mechanism.
- **Tasks**:
  - Implement a placeholder alert system (e.g., log to console).
  - Design a framework for future alert enhancements (e.g., email, push notifications).

### Phase 6: Testing and Optimization
- **Goal**: Ensure the tool is reliable and efficient.
- **Tasks**:
  - Test the tool with multiple wallet addresses.
  - Optimize data fetching and error handling.
  - Verify the accuracy of token account creation time detection.

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1: Initial Setup** - 1 day
- **Phase 2: Wallet Monitoring** - 2 to 3 days
- **Phase 3: Token Account Creation Time** - 2 to 3 days
- **Phase 4: Data Persistence** - 1 to 2 days
- **Phase 5: Alerting System** - 1 to 2 days
- **Phase 6: Testing and Optimization** - 2 to 3 days

**Total Estimated Time**: Approximately 9 to 14 days

## Future Enhancements
1. **Advanced Alerting**
   - Integrate with external services for notifications (e.g., email, SMS, or webhook integrations).
2. **Database Migration**
   - Upgrade to a more robust database solution if the need arises.
3. **Web Interface**
   - Develop a simple web dashboard to visualize token holdings and alert history.
4. **Historical Data Analysis**
   - Implement features to analyze and display historical changes in token holdings.

## Conclusion
This project will provide valuable insights into Solana wallet activity and lay the foundation for more advanced blockchain monitoring tools.
The initial implementation will be kept simple and cost-effective, with room for scalability and feature expansion.
