## Current State of the System
This project is in the **very early stages** of development. It currently monitors a selected list of Solana wallets, tracking new token holdings and balance changes. Alerts are sent to a dedicated channel on Discord, and **all alerts should be treated with caution**. Remember to do your own research (DYOR) when making any financial decisions based on this data.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This tool is experimental. Alerts are for informational purposes and may not always indicate actionable insights. Use this tool to aid your analysis but proceed with caution.

### Want to See the System in Action?

## Project Vision
The vision is to develop a sophisticated Go-based tool for automated tracking and analysis of Solana wallet behaviors. The project will evolve from a simple monitoring tool into a comprehensive on-chain analysis platform capable of identifying potential insider trading activities.

**Building in Public**: Follow along as the project develops! Contributions, feedback, and discussions are welcome and encouraged.
