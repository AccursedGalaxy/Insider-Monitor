## Feature Highlights

### Multi-Wallet Monitoring

Monitor an unlimited number of Solana wallets simultaneously, with each wallet's tokens tracked independently. Perfect for tracking multiple accounts, projects, or investment portfolios.

    B --> E["Token A"];
    B --> F["Token B"];
    C --> G["Token C"];
    D --> H["Token A"];
    D --> I["Token D"];
```

### Advanced Token Filtering

Control exactly which tokens are monitored with flexible scan modes:

- **Global configuration**: Set default scan behavior for all wallets
- **Per-wallet customization**: Configure different scan modes for different wallets
- **Three scan modes**:
    - **All**: Monitor all tokens in a wallet
    - **Whitelist**: Only monitor specific tokens you care about
    - **Blacklist**: Monitor all tokens except those you specify

This allows you to focus on important tokens and reduce noise from airdrops or dust.

### Real-Time Alerts

Receive instant notifications when significant token balance changes are detected:

- ðŸŸ¢ **Info level** for minor changes
- ðŸŸ¡ **Warning level** for moderate changes
- ðŸ”´ **Critical level** for major changes
