# Feature Ideas

This document outlines potential features and enhancements for Solana Insider Monitor.
As an open source project, we welcome contributions that implement these ideas or suggest new ones.

## High Priority Features

### Wallet Management Enhancements

#### Wallet Labeling
Add the ability to assign human-readable labels to wallet addresses for easier identification:

```json
{
    "labeled_wallets": [
        {
            "address": "55kBY9yxqQzj2zxZqRkqENYq6R8PkXmn5GKyQN9YeVFr",
            "label": "Treasury",
            "description": "Main treasury wallet"
        },
        {
            "address": "DWuopnuSqYdBhCXqxfqjqzPGibnhkj6SQqFvgC4jkvjF",
            "label": "Development Fund",
            "description": "Grants and developer incentives"
        }
    ]
}
```

Make sure to provide the option to display these labels in the console output, notifications, and the web interface.

#### Wallet Grouping
Support for organizing wallets into logical groups:

```json
{
    "wallet_groups": {
        "critical": [
            "55kBY9yxqQzj2zxZqRkqENYq6R8PkXmn5GKyQN9YeVFr"
        ],
        "investments": [
            "DWuopnuSqYdBhCXqxfqjqzPGibnhkj6SQqFvgC4jkvjF"
        ],
        "defi": [
            "Another_Wallet_Address"
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Per-Wallet Alert Thresholds
Allow setting different alert thresholds for different wallets:

```json
{
    "wallet_alerts": [
        {
            "address": "55kBY9yxqQzj2zxZqRkqENYq6R8PkXmn5GKyQN9YeVFr",
            "minimum_balance": 10000,
            "significant_change": 0.05
        },
        {
            "address": "DWuopnuSqYdBhCXqxfqjqzPGibnhkj6SQqFvgC4jkvjF",
            "minimum_balance": 1000,
            "significant_change": 0.20
        }
    ]
}
```

### Scan System Improvement
Re introduce feature to allow different scanning modes.

all - scan all tokens for selected wallets
whitelist - only scan whitelisted tokens for selected wallets
blacklist - scan all tokens for selected wallets apart from blacklisted ones

### Alert System Improvements

#### Multiple Configuration Profiles
Support for different configuration profiles (e.g., "high alert", "normal monitoring", "low priority"):

```json
{
    "profiles": {
        "high_alert": {
            "scan_interval": "30s",
            "alerts": {
                "minimum_balance": 100,
                "significant_change": 0.05
            }
        },
        "normal": {
            "scan_interval": "2m",
            "alerts": {
                "minimum_balance": 1000,
                "significant_change": 0.20
            }
        }
    },
    "active_profile": "normal"
}
```

#### Alert Routing Rules
Create rules for routing different types of alerts to different channels:

```json
{
    "alert_routes": [
        {
            "condition": "balance_change > 100000",
            "action": "discord_critical"
        },
        {
            "condition": "token_symbol == 'SOL'",
            "action": "discord_sol_channel"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Enhanced Discord Integration
Add advanced Discord webhook features:

```json
    "discord": {
        "enabled": true,
        "webhook_url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/your-webhook-url",
        "channel_id": "your-channel-id",
        "critical_webhook_url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/critical-webhook-url",
        "warning_webhook_url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/warning-webhook-url",
        "message_prefix": "ðŸš¨ ALERT",
        "critical_mention": "<@&ROLE_ID>",
        "warning_mention": "<@USER_ID>"
    }
}
```

This would allow:
- Different webhooks for different alert severity levels
- Custom message prefixes
- Role or user mentions based on alert severity

## Medium Priority Features

### Monitoring Enhancements

#### Transaction Monitoring
Monitor specific transaction types, not just balance changes:

```json
{
    "transaction_monitoring": {
        "enabled": true,
        "types": ["swap", "transfer", "stake"]
    }
}
```

#### Historical Data Analysis
Add tools for analyzing historical wallet activity and visualizing trends.

#### Token Price Integration
Include token price data to show value changes in USD or other currencies.
